# job-portal-with-symfony-4
A basic job board built with Symfony 4.

Features, as of March 10, 2018, include :
- browse job ads (by date, or category)
- register (database as a user provider)
- log in
- if logged in: able to publish new job ads

I need to work on :
- validation of forms and files
- implement sessions: then adding the edit and delete functionnality (i.e. link the published ads to the logged in user)
